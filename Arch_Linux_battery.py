# Arch linux battery script - inspired by romeo-folie

# This script is based on the 40%-80% battery 
# The 40 80 battery rule can still be used today but it is no longer the best rule to apply 
# to improve laptop battery life because laptops nowadays are now 
# built with batteries that are able to do well in one full charge cycle. 
# While you can still use the 40 80 rule, it wonâ€™t always apply to newer batteries.
